/*
 * Why passing the owner task is acceptable and correct here
 * The Behavior Tree architecture has a unique and very specific relationship
 * between its components that mitigates the dangers of this coupling and makes it beneficial.
 * A Symbiotic, Private Relationship: A BTCondition is not a general-purpose object.
 * Its entire existence is predicated on being attached to a BehaviorTask.
 * It is a decorator, an extension of the task's logic. It has no meaning or purpose on its own.
 * The relationship is not between two independent systems, but between a component and its dedicated sub-component.
 * Think of it less like two separate classes and more like an "externalized method" of the BehaviorTask.
 * The "Inversion of Control" Principle: The primary reason for the event-driven CooldownCondition
 * is to allow the condition to react to the task's result.
 * The alternative would be for the BehaviorTask to have special logic to handle this,
 * violates the Open/Closed Principle.
 * Every time you invent a new special condition, you have to modify the base BehaviorTask class.
