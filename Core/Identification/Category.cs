/// <summary>
///     A data-driven Resource representing a high-level, abstract category or "tag".
///     This is a cornerstone of the world's semantic system, allowing for broad-level grouping and querying.
///     For example, this allows an AI to ask "is there an Enemy nearby?" and get a match for any
///     object whose Identity belongs to the "Enemy" category.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Crucially, because it is a Resource, it can contain its own data, such as default relationships
///     to other categories, which a simple string tag (like a Godot Group) cannot do.
/// </remarks>
